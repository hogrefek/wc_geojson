# Repository Name: wc_geojson
## Repository Purpose:
**Holds GeoJSON files, converted from other file types, for use in Web Mpping Projects**
Beginning with Lab 4, but I figure but I figure having a personal repository with all of my potentially useful files will be a good practice.

## Current repsoitory contents:
File Name|File Size (kb)|Data Introduction
---------|--------------|-----------------
orcnty24_wgs84.geojson|13,217|Oregon Counties, I did this conversion agin with a shapefile I'd alreday been using.
orcnty24_wgs84_simp.json|1,356|I set the simplification for 10% of original size, (then I started losing detail) result came very close to setting.
wc_taxlots_12072015_wgs84.geojson|21,320|Tax Lot data detailing property ownership for all of Wallowa County.
wc_taxlots_12072015_wgs84_simp.json|13,257|I set the simplification for 30% of original size (then I started losing detail), result was not as close - about 50% of original.
