# Repository Name: wc_geojson
## Repository Purpose:
**Holds GeoJSON files, converted from other file types, for use in Web Mapping Projects**

>Beginning with files for Lab 4, but I figure  having a personal repository with all of my potentially useful files will be a good practice.

## Current repository contents:
